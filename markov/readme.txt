 * Describe the type parameters of your symbol table (i.e., what is   *
 * the key type and what is the value type). How did you use the      *
 * symbol table to implement the random() method.                     *
 **********************************************************************/
For the one argument freq method, I used a symbol table with a key type
of String and a value type of array. For the two argument freq method, I
used a symbol table with a key type of String and a value type of an
array of integers.


/**********************************************************************
 * The main() method we provide in the checklist does not test your   *
 * random() method. Describe how you tested it.                       *
 **********************************************************************/
I did a while loop for a thousand times and counted each time a certain
character was returned. I checked to make sure that the ratio between the
characters made sense.

 * model and what text file you used.                                 *
